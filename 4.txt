For the given tasks, here are the corresponding SQL queries:

1. Find the details of the teacher having a salary of 10000:

```sql
SELECT * FROM teacher_info WHERE Sal = 10000;
```

2. Find the teacher with status 'A' and salary 50000:

```sql
SELECT * FROM teacher_info WHERE Status = 'A' AND Sal = 50000;
```

3. Find the teacher's salary > 20000:

```sql
SELECT * FROM teacher_info WHERE Sal > 20000;
```

4. Find the teachers with status 'A' with salary ascending:

```sql
SELECT * FROM teacher_info WHERE Status = 'A' ORDER BY Sal ASC;
```

5. Count the total number of teachers:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_teachers FROM teacher_info;
```

6. Update the department of teachers to 'EnTc' where the salary is greater than 20000:

```sql
UPDATE teacher_info SET Branch = 'EnTc' WHERE Sal > 20000;
```

7. Increment the salary of teachers with 10000 whose status is 'A':

```sql
UPDATE teacher_info SET Sal = Sal + 1000 WHERE Status = 'A' AND Sal = 10000;
```

8. Add a field called 'joining_date' in the `teacher_info` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE teacher_info ADD COLUMN joining_date DATE;
```

9. Delete the teacher with id 't04':

```sql
DELETE FROM teacher_info WHERE Teacher_id = 't04';
```

10. Drop the table `teacher_info`:

```sql
DROP TABLE teacher_info;
```

Note: Make sure to review and test these queries in a safe environment before applying them to a production database.
