Certainly! Here are the queries based on the given schema:

1. Count the total number of students:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalStudents
FROM Student;
```

2. Count the number of students staying in Pune:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS PuneStudents
FROM Student
WHERE saddr = 'Pune';
```

3. Display the different cities of students:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT saddr AS DifferentCities
FROM Student;
```

4. Group by address and show the result in decreasing order:

```sql
SELECT saddr, COUNT(*) AS StudentCount
FROM Student
GROUP BY saddr
ORDER BY StudentCount DESC;
```

5. Group by address and limit the result set to 2 rows:

```sql
SELECT saddr, COUNT(*) AS StudentCount
FROM Student
GROUP BY saddr
ORDER BY StudentCount DESC
LIMIT 2;
```

6. Project increased marks of students by 100:

```sql
SELECT sname, smarks + 100 AS IncreasedMarks
FROM Student;
```

7. Project increased marks of students by 100 and decreased by 50:

```sql
SELECT sname, smarks + 100 AS IncreasedMarks, smarks - 50 AS DecreasedMarks
FROM Student;
```

8. Find the total marks of students grouped by city:

```sql
SELECT saddr, SUM(smarks) AS TotalMarks
FROM Student
GROUP BY saddr;
```

9. Find the maximum and minimum marks student city-wise:

```sql
SELECT saddr, MAX(smarks) AS MaxMarks, MIN(smarks) AS MinMarks
FROM Student
GROUP BY saddr;
```

These queries should help you analyze the data in various ways based on aggregation.
