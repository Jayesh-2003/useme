Certainly! Here are the SQL queries for the given tasks:

1. Find average marks of each student, along with the name of the student:

```sql
SELECT s.Roll_no, s.Name, AVG(m.marks) AS average_marks
FROM Student s
JOIN Marks m ON s.Roll_no = m.Roll_no
GROUP BY s.Roll_no, s.Name;
```

2. Find how many students have failed in the subject “DBMS”:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS failed_students
FROM Marks
WHERE sub_code = 'DBMS' AND marks < 40;
```

3. Display the highest & lowest marks for every subject:

```sql
SELECT sub_code,
       MAX(marks) AS highest_marks,
       MIN(marks) AS lowest_marks
FROM Marks
GROUP BY sub_code;
```

4. Find students with a city starting from 'P':

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Student
WHERE City LIKE 'P%';
```

5. Find students with a city name ending with 'Pur':

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Student
WHERE City LIKE '%Pur';
```

6. Display Subject Name, Highest & lowest marks scored:

```sql
SELECT s.sub_name,
       MAX(m.marks) AS highest_marks,
       MIN(m.marks) AS lowest_marks
FROM Subject s
JOIN Marks m ON s.sub_code = m.sub_code
GROUP BY s.sub_name;
```

Please note that these queries assume certain constraints and data types in your schema. Adjustments may be needed based on your specific database structure.
