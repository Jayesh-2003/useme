Assuming you are working with an SQL database, you can use the following SQL queries for the given collection:

a. Find the details of the teacher having a salary of 10000:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM teacher_info
WHERE Sal = 10000;
```

b. Find the teacher with status 'A' and a salary of 50000:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM teacher_info
WHERE Status = 'A' AND Sal = 50000;
```

c. Find the teacher with a salary greater than 20000:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM teacher_info
WHERE Sal > 20000;
```

d. Find the teachers with status 'A' with salary ascending:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM teacher_info
WHERE Status = 'A'
ORDER BY Sal ASC;
```

e. Count the total number of teachers:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalTeachers
FROM teacher_info;
```

f. Update the department of teachers to 'EnTc' where salary is greater than 20000:

```sql
UPDATE teacher_info
SET Branch = 'EnTc'
WHERE Sal > 20000;
```

g. Increment the salary of teachers with 10000 whose status is 'A':

```sql
UPDATE teacher_info
SET Sal = Sal + 10000
WHERE Sal = 10000 AND Status = 'A';
```

h. Add a field called joining date in the teacher_info collection:

```sql
ALTER TABLE teacher_info
ADD COLUMN JoiningDate DATE;
```

Note: You may need to choose an appropriate data type for the JoiningDate field based on your requirements.

i. Delete the teacher with id 't04':

```sql
DELETE FROM teacher_info
WHERE Teacher_id = 't04';
```

j. Drop table teacher_info:

```sql
DROP TABLE teacher_info;
```

These queries are written assuming the SQL syntax and may need to be adjusted based on the specific database management system you are using (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
